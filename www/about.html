<b>What is a web server?</b>
A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. 
The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, 
processing and delivering webpages to users. Besides HTTP, web servers also support 
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol), used for email, 
file transfer and storage.

Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with 
other connected devices, while web server software controls how a user accesses hosted files. 
The web server process is an example of the client/server model. 
All computers that host websites must have web server software.

<b>How do web servers work?</b>
Web server software is accessed through the domain names of websites and ensures the delivery 
of the site's content to the requesting user. The software side is also comprised of several components, 
with at least an HTTP server. The HTTP server is able to understand HTTP and URLs. As hardware, 
a web server is a computer that stores web server software and other files related to a website, 
such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files.

When a web browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox, needs a file that's hosted on a web server, 
the browser will request the file by HTTP. When the request is received by the web server, 
the HTTP server will accept the request, find the content and send it back to the browser through HTTP.

More specifically, when a browser requests a page from a web server, the process will follow a series of steps. 
First, a person will specify a URL in a web browser's address bar. The web browser will then obtain the 
IP address of the domain name -- either translating the URL through DNS (Domain Name System) or by searching in its cache. 
This will bring the browser to a web server. The browser will then request the specific file from the web server by an HTTP request. 
The web server will respond, sending the browser the requested page, again, through HTTP. 
If the requested page does not exist or if something goes wrong, the web server will respond with an error message. 
The browser will then be able to display the webpage.
